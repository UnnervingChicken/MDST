Hi,
I am Mudit Johar, a Freshman at Umich. I come from Skyline High School in Sammamish, Washington. I am planning on doing Computer Science. A fun fact about me is that I was called the "bookwurm"in my high school since I read books while walking, when the teachers are talking(not the greatest thing but I was not the greatest student and had my books taken from me again and again). I can also open lockers while reading a book!
